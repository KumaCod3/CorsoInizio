## just old first experiment

Hi, I was learning **Unity** and I decided to put here the first, ugly result of the course execrcise so I would also exercise git, and how to deploy a web game.
I'm taking a little time to make it look better, but I wont change the original code from my first draft.
The online game is done for now. But it misses sounds and it only work properly from PC...
