# .gitignore

## just old first experiment

Hi, I was learning **Unity** and I decided to put here the first, ugly result of the course execrcise so I would also exercise git, and how to deploy a web game.
I'm taking a little time to make it look better, but I wont change the original code from my first draft.
so far, the webpage is not up to date, I will rebuilt it once I finish to put together all the little games in one.
