# .gitignore

## just old first experiment

Hi, I was learning **Unityt** and I decided to put here the first, ugly result of the course execrcise so I would also exercise git, and how to deploy a web game.
It would be best to ignore everything in here, 
if you can't avoid it, just try out the browser app result (Just a little thing that resemble packman).
